# Clash Arena

This project, Milestone 1, represents the culmination of knowledge acquired from the User-Centric Front-end portion of the Full Stack Web Develpoer Course with Code Institute.  
The project comprises a static front-end website that displays useful data for the viewer.

**Business Case:**
Clash Arena is a tournament hosting website for casual and competative gamers of popular game titles such as Call of Duty: Warzone, Apex Legends and Fortnite.
The aim of Clash Arena to develop an online community of gamers through promotion of ongoing, organised tournaments and a Discord server (for the purposes of this project, there will only be a link to the main Discord website)  

## UX

**Website UX Goals**

Clash Arena aims to do away with old gamer stereotypes by bringing a new and sleek platform, that makes tournament style competition open to all players.

- Convey the Clash mission statement as quickly as possible (PLAY. COMPETE. WIN).
- Sell the service through tournament's organised by Clash itself, and also user organised tournaments hosted on the Clash platform.
- Target a broad user base.
- Improve user satisfaction.

**User UX Goals**

- Gain access to the websites offers and services with miniml effort.
- Give the user the experience they deserve.
- Reduce the users work load by providing clarity and ease of use.
- Feedback with ease.


### User Story - First Time Visitor

* As a first time user, I want to be able to land on the main page of the website and navigate to all sections easily and smoothly.
* As a first time user, I want to understand within the first 10 seconds what the purpose of the website is.
* As a first time user, I want to access information about the product or service being offered.
* As a first time user, I want to be able to have full website functionality on all devices - mobile, tablet, PC.  
* As a first time user, I want to be able to contact the companies help and/or customer services. 
 
### User Story - Repeat Visitor

* As a repeat user, I want to be able to easily set up my own tournaments.
* As a repeat user, I want to be kept informed about ongoing news and promotions.
* As a repeat user, I want to be able to make new friends to play online with.

### Wireframe

In the initial forming phase I put together this wireframe using Balsamiq Mockups. While the website has maintained the majority of the features, many changes were made along the way. I will try to avoid making such drastic changes in future projects as it caused a lot of delays and changes on the fly during development.

### Website Architecture - Hierarchy

The Website follows a modern layout comprising a main scroll homepage and navbar that leads to three more pages - Tournaments, Contact and Community, also an inline navbar button links to the Community Discord page. 
All of the pages are linked which makes navigation simple and straightforward.

Here we see how the home page looks when viewed on multiple devices:

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea

As previously mentioned, my website follows a modern design style. 

The color pallette features many dark, neon, and contrasting electric colours that you find on many websites such as Twitch where a lot of gamers stream their content.

* Navigation bar 

Initially I had designed a logo using free third party software but decided to use just the name _"CLASH"_ in italics in pink against a dark, semi-transparent navbar background.   

The navbar has five inline elements for navigation positioned to the right (end) side of the bar. There are "Home", "Tournament", "Contact", "Community" links and a Discord button.
