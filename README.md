# Clash Arena

This project, Milestone project 1, represents the culmination of knowledge acquired from the User-Centric Front-end portion of the Full Stack Web Develpoer Course with Code Institute.  
The project comprises a static front-end website that displays useful data for the viewer.

**Business Case:**
Clash Arena is a tournament hosting website for casual and competative gamers of popular game titles such as Call of Duty: Warzone, Apex Legends and Fortnite.
The aim of Clash Arena to develop an online community of gamers through promotion of ongoing, organised tournaments and a Discord server (for the purposes of this project, there will only be a link to the main Discord website)  

## UX
